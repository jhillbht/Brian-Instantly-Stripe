# Annual Reminder Automation System

## Overview

This system automates the timing and delivery of annual renewal reminders to past customers, ensuring they receive timely notifications before important deadlines like LLC renewals, business license renewals, or other annual services.

## Automation Strategy

### Timing Logic

**Primary Reminder Schedule**:
1. **11 Months After Purchase**: Initial gentle reminder
2. **10 Months After Purchase**: Educational content about renewal process
3. **9 Months After Purchase**: Early bird renewal offer
4. **6 Months After Purchase**: Mid-year check-in
5. **3 Months Before Due**: Urgent renewal reminder
6. **1 Month Before Due**: Final reminder with deadline emphasis
7. **1 Week Before Due**: Last chance notification

### Renewal Date Calculation

```javascript
class RenewalDateCalculator {
  constructor(originalPurchaseDate) {
    this.originalDate = new Date(originalPurchaseDate);
    this.renewalDate = new Date(this.originalDate);
    this.renewalDate.setFullYear(this.renewalDate.getFullYear() + 1);
  }

  getReminderDates() {
    const reminders = [];
    
    // 11 months after original purchase
    const firstReminder = new Date(this.originalDate);
    firstReminder.setMonth(firstReminder.getMonth() + 11);
    reminders.push({
      type: 'initial_reminder',
      date: firstReminder,
      daysUntilRenewal: this.daysBetween(firstReminder, this.renewalDate),
      emailType: 'gentle_reminder'
    });

    // 10 months after original purchase
    const educationalReminder = new Date(this.originalDate);
    educationalReminder.setMonth(educationalReminder.getMonth() + 10);
    reminders.push({
      type: 'educational',
      date: educationalReminder,
      daysUntilRenewal: this.daysBetween(educationalReminder, this.renewalDate),
      emailType: 'renewal_education'
    });

    // 9 months after original purchase (early bird)
    const earlyBirdReminder = new Date(this.originalDate);
    earlyBirdReminder.setMonth(earlyBirdReminder.getMonth() + 9);
    reminders.push({
      type: 'early_bird',
      date: earlyBirdReminder,
      daysUntilRenewal: this.daysBetween(earlyBirdReminder, this.renewalDate),
      emailType: 'early_bird_offer'
    });

    // 3 months before renewal (urgent)
    const urgentReminder = new Date(this.renewalDate);
    urgentReminder.setMonth(urgentReminder.getMonth() - 3);
    reminders.push({
      type: 'urgent',
      date: urgentReminder,
      daysUntilRenewal: 90,
      emailType: 'urgent_reminder'
    });

    // 1 month before renewal (final)
    const finalReminder = new Date(this.renewalDate);
    finalReminder.setMonth(finalReminder.getMonth() - 1);
    reminders.push({
      type: 'final',
      date: finalReminder,
      daysUntilRenewal: 30,
      emailType: 'final_reminder'
    });

    // 1 week before renewal (last chance)
    const lastChanceReminder = new Date(this.renewalDate);
    lastChanceReminder.setDate(lastChanceReminder.getDate() - 7);
    reminders.push({
      type: 'last_chance',
      date: lastChanceReminder,
      daysUntilRenewal: 7,
      emailType: 'last_chance'
    });

    return reminders.filter(reminder => reminder.date > new Date()); // Only future reminders
  }

  daysBetween(date1, date2) {
    const oneDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
    return Math.round(Math.abs((date2 - date1) / oneDay));
  }
}
```

## Email Sequence Templates

### Sequence 1: Initial Gentle Reminder (11 months)

**Subject**: "Your [State] LLC is up for renewal next year"

**Content**:
```
Hi [FirstName],

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out because your [State] LLC that we helped you register on [OriginalDate] will be up for renewal on [RenewalDate].

I know it might seem early to think about it now, but I like to give our clients plenty of advance notice so nothing falls through the cracks.

Here's what you need to know:
• Your renewal deadline is [RenewalDate]
• [State] requires annual renewal for LLCs
• The process typically takes 2-3 business days
• Renewal fees may have changed since last year

No need to do anything right now – just wanted to put it on your radar. I'll follow up closer to the deadline with all the details and make the renewal process as smooth as possible.

If you have any questions in the meantime, just reply to this email.

Best regards,
[YourName]

P.S. We've helped over [NumberOfClients] business owners stay compliant with their renewals. You're in good hands!
```

### Sequence 2: Educational Content (10 months)

**Subject**: "What happens if you miss your [State] LLC renewal?"

**Content**:
```
Hi [FirstName],

Following up on my previous email about your upcoming LLC renewal on [RenewalDate].

I thought it would be helpful to share what I've learned from working with hundreds of business owners in [State]:

**What happens if you miss the deadline:**
• Administrative dissolution of your LLC
• Loss of legal protections
• Potential penalties and reinstatement fees
• Difficulty doing business under your LLC name

**Why early renewal makes sense:**
• Avoid the last-minute rush
• Ensure continuous legal protection
• Peace of mind for another full year
• Lock in current renewal fees (they often increase)

**The good news:**
The renewal process is straightforward, and I'll handle all the paperwork for you when the time comes.

Questions about the process? Just reply to this email.

Best,
[YourName]
```

### Sequence 3: Early Bird Offer (9 months)

**Subject**: "🚨 FINAL NOTICE: [State] LLC renewal due [RenewalDate]"

```
Hi [FirstName],

This is your final reminder that your [State] LLC renewal is due on [RenewalDate] – just 30 days away.

**Critical timeline:**
• Today: [CurrentDate]

If your LLC isn't renewed by the deadline, it will be administratively dissolved, which means:

2. I'll send the renewal packet within 2 hours
3. Return completed forms within 24 hours

**Content**:
```
Hi [FirstName],

This is your absolute final notice.

Your [State] LLC will be DISSOLVED in just 7 days if not renewed by [RenewalDate].

This means:
• Your business will lose legal status
• No liability protection
• Cannot operate legally under LLC name
• Expensive reinstatement required

**There's still time, but you must act TODAY.**

Emergency renewal process:
1. Reply "EMERGENCY RENEWAL" right now
2. I'll prepare documents immediately
3. Rush processing with the state
4. Your LLC stays protected

**This is your last opportunity to avoid dissolution.**

The cost of emergency renewal today: $[EmergencyFee]

Your business protection depends on it.

## Automation Implementation

### Instantly Sequence Setup

```javascript
async function createRenewalSequence(campaignId, customerData) {
  const calculator = new RenewalDateCalculator(customerData.originalPurchaseDate);
  const reminders = calculator.getReminderDates();

  const sequenceSteps = reminders.map((reminder, index) => ({
    stepNumber: index + 1,
    delayDays: Math.ceil((reminder.date - new Date()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)),
    emailTemplate: getEmailTemplate(reminder.emailType, customerData),
    conditions: {
      skipIfReplied: true,
      skipIfUnsubscribed: true,
      skipIfPurchased: true // Custom condition to check if already renewed
    }
  }));

  const sequence = await instantly.createSequence({
    campaignId: campaignId,
    name: `${customerData.billingState} Renewal Reminders - ${customerData.renewalDate.getFullYear()}`,
    steps: sequenceSteps,
    settings: {
      businessHoursOnly: true,
      timezone: getTimezoneByState(customerData.billingState),
      pauseOnReply: true,
      maxEmailsPerDay: 1
    }
  });

  return sequence;
}
```

### Email Template Generation

    },
    renewal_education: {
      subject: `What happens if you miss your ${customerData.billingState} LLC renewal?`,

  return `
Hi ${customerData.firstName},

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out because your ${customerData.billingState} LLC that we helped you register on ${customerData.originalPurchaseDate.toLocaleDateString()} will be up for renewal on ${customerData.renewalDate.toLocaleDateString()}.

Here's what you need to know:
• Your renewal deadline is ${customerData.renewalDate.toLocaleDateString()}

  }
};
```

### Performance Tracking

```javascript
