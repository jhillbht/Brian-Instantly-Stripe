# Brian Instantly Stripe Integration

A comprehensive customer retention and lifecycle marketing system that automatically converts Stripe customers into Instantly leads organized by state and purchase date for annual renewal reminders and cross-selling opportunities.

## 🎯 Specific Business Purpose

**Primary Use Case**: Annual business service renewals (LLC registrations, business licenses, professional services)  
**Secondary Use Case**: Cross-selling complementary business services to existing customers  
**Audience**: Past customers (warm audience) - NOT cold outreach

## 🔄 Core Workflow

```
Stripe Purchase → Webhook Trigger → Extract Customer Data → 
Generate Campaign Name ([State] [Month] [Day] [Year]) → 
Create/Find Instantly Campaign → Add Customer as Lead → 
Trigger Welcome + Annual Reminder Sequences
```

**Example**: Customer purchases LLC registration in Virginia on April 1st, 2024 → Added to campaign **"Virginia April 1st 2025"** for renewal reminders.

4. **Create Lead**: Add customer to appropriate Instantly campaign
5. **Trigger Sequences**: Welcome emails + annual reminder scheduling

### Key Components
